## Email Verification Banner Dismissal

The GALAX app includes an email verification banner that appears at the top of authenticated pages when a user's email is not verified. To dismiss this banner:

1. **Locate the X button**: The banner appears as an orange/yellow notification at the top of the page with an "Email Verification Required" message
2. **Click the X button**: The X button is located on the right side of the banner
3. **Banner dismissed**: The banner will fade out and no longer cover content when taking screenshots

This ensures clean screenshots without the verification warning overlaying important content.
